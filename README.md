## DS Assignment part -1 contains a house price dataset. After performing EDA and feature engineering, I have trained and evalusted the performance of different regressor models using optuna.
## DS Assignment Part -2 contains two datasets related to products and prices on amazon and flipkart. Using ML/DL techniques, matching similar products from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset. Once similar products are matched, displaying the retail price from FK and AMZ side by side.
